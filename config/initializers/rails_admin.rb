  # If you want to track changes on your models:
  # config.audit_with :history, User

  # Or with a PaperTrail: (you need to install it first)
  # config.audit_with :paper_trail, User

  # Set the admin name here (optional second array element will appear in a beautiful RailsAdmin red ©)

  #   # Configuration here will affect all included models in all scopes, handle with care!

  #     fields_of_type :date do

  #  ==> Model specific configuration
  # Keep in mind that *all* configuration blocks are optional.
  # RailsAdmin will try his best to provide the best defaults for each section, for each field.
  # Try to override as few things as possible, in the most generic way. Try to avoid setting labels for models and attributes, use ActiveRecord I18n API instead.
  # Less code is better code!
  # config.model MyModel do
  #   # Cross-section field configuration
  #   object_label_method :name     # Name of the method called for pretty printing an *instance* of ModelName
  #   label 'My model'              # Name of ModelName (smartly defaults to ActiveRecord's I18n API)
  #   label_plural 'My models'      # Same, plural
  #   weight -1                     # Navigation priority. Bigger is higher.
  #   parent OtherModel             # Set parent model for navigation. MyModel will be nested below. OtherModel will be on first position of the dropdown
  #   navigation_label              # Sets dropdown entry's name in navigation. Only for parents!
  #   # Section specific configuration:
  #   list do
  #     filters [:id, :name]  # Array of field names which filters should be shown by default in the table header
  #     items_per_page 100    # Override default_items_per_page
  #     sort_by :id           # Sort column (default is primary key)
  #     sort_reverse true     # Sort direction (default is true for primary key, last created first)
  #     # Here goes the fields configuration for the list view
  #   end
